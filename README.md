# React + Vite

Curently i cannot deploy the project using Github Pages,
the porject already build with this code, but it always breaking if i try to run it via live server or accessing via Github Pages.

I'm using Vite so the project can be run with minimum requirement.
Also i'm using PNPM instead of NPM to run the project so it can be more faster.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
